# CSS Layout

## Summary
Today's reading was all about flexbox. Flexbox is a way of layingout out elements in rows or columns. It is a helpful because filling in or shrinking space is easily done with flexbox. You wouldn't have to do math to figure out how much margin or width an element would need in order to space it evenly across a page with other elements. This can be done on both the horizontal and vertical axis of a page. Flexbox has properties that let you wrap, reorder, space, or align items in different ways.

## Learn CSS - Flexbox
1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
- This means that flexbox is designed to format content on the x and y axis only.
- If you wanted to make something 3D, you would need to work on the z axis. I think you can do this with CSS, but not sure how. WebGL is another way to make 3D objects on computer screens.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
- The main is axis is the main direction the flex items are laid out, so in columns or rows.
- The cross axis is the perpendicular axis
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
- Some flexbox properties reorder elements visually, but this doesn't reorder them logically. This could make the page confusing to somone using a screen reader.
- Flexbox is not supported with all browsers. Most modern browsers support flexbox, but older browsers may not

## CSS Layout - Flexbox
1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
- Flex has some additional features that float doesn't. A big one is that flex is responsive and it is easy to adjust content based on the screen size. Items can be reordered in a differnt way than what they are in the DOM. It is much easier to space items easily so they evenly spread the length of a page. Also, the alignment can be applied to the cross axis. This would be nice if you had a side navigation bar.

2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
- I'm not much of a graphic designer, but being able to create programs that make sense and visually guide a user through the page is important. Flexbox is another tool that will help with that. It will also help make webpages more versatile and responsive so that users on any screen size are able to view the page.

## Things I want to learn more about
- I've seen some of the things that other people have created using WebGL, and they make some really cool stuff with. I would like to learn how to use WebGL.
