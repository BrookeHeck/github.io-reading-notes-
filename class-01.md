# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## Getting Started
1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.
Make a request to the DNS
\
Receive the IP address
\
Send the server an HTTP request
\
A 200 OK means you can access
\
The server sends the browser files to process
\
The browser assembles to visually express
\


2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
- The browser begins with parsing the HTML code sent returned by an external server and uses this to recognize CSS and scripts that are needed to render the webpage. The browser continues to parse the HTML code, but also sends requests to the server for the CSS and js files. Next, the browser parses the CSS and js files. With the parsed code, a DOM tree is made with the HTML, a CSSOM tree is made with the CSS, and JavaScript code is compiled and executed. The browser applies the styles from the CSSOM to the DOM and executes JavaScript to show a visual representation of the code to a user.

3. How can you find images to add to a Website?
- Images can be added by searching Google Images and either saving the image to somewhere in your local directory or by copying the web address. Google has a license filter to use so that copyright laws are not broken.
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is a really cool website that has thousands of free images that can be used.

4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
- A string should have quotes (single and double both work in javascript)
\
``` let str = 'This is how to make a string'; ```
- Numbers don't have quotes
\
``` let num = 19; ```

5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?
- Variables are used to store values in JavaScript. Variables allow us to write dynamic code that changes variables. This makes programs interactive or personalized.

## Introduction to HTML
1. What is an HTML attribute?
2. Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.
3. What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?
4. What Elements does a “typical” website include?
5. How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?
6. How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

## Things I want to know more about
- I have much more of a coding background than a networking background. I do know that sending data back and forth is important part of being able to provide the source code and data to the user. I would like to know more about internet protocols and how requests are made and fulfilled.
- Working with API's is such an important part of web development. I would like to know about the ins and outs of how APIs work and how to use them.
