# Event Driven Applications

## Event Driven Programming
1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
- EventEmitter

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
- By using both together, applications are built with units that can speak and interact with one another.
- It also helps because each object contains all its own behavioral functions, this means the object behavior doesn't need t obe accessed by external objects. This becomes helpful as code gets more complex.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
- This is very helpful on a backend server because now the communication between servers has the potential to be much more broad. Now when an event is triggered, the backend server can have many events happening and send requests to many different servers when an event is triggered. An example is a multiplayer game. Without event driven programming a user could only play the game by themselves, but event driven programming on the backend can connect logged in users and have them play one another.
