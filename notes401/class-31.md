# Context API

## Context API
1. What can React Context provide your app?
- provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props at every level

2. Why might we use Context?
- when you have 'global' variables
- examples could be an authenticated user, theme, or preferred language

3. Why should we use it sparingly?
- only use context when it is really needed because it can make reusing components difficult
