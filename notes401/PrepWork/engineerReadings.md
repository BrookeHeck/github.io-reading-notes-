# Engineering Readings

## Discussion Questions
1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
    - I don't think my background in air transportation is going to help a whole lot as a software developer, but I think being a supervisor in the military has given me some skills that are essential to coding. The military preaches resilience and attention to detail and I think these are the two skills that help me the most when I'm writing code.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
    - start a white board of the specific feature that I'm trying to work on
    - break the feature down into smaller parts that I can get working individually and then bring together
    - write out pseudo code for what I'm trying to do
