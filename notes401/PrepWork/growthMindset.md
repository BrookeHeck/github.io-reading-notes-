# Growth Mindset

The first article about deliberate practice reminded of me of one of my favorite Thomas Paine quotes, "What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods." It's been said a lot of different ways, but basically, the most rewarding things in life are the most difficult to accomplish.

The video,  'The power of believing you can improve' made me think a lot about most of my time in high school and college. I was definitely part of a culture that cared more about grades rather than actually learning anything and I definitely didn't get as much out of school as I could have.
