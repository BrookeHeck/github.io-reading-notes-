# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Discussion Questions
1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
  - Recursion is not better in terms of efficiency, but sometimes it makes a solution clearer. It is usually less code because generally it is just a base case and and the function call, but you could end up with a very large call stack. If the recursive code is easier to read and you know your data inputs will be small, then you can use recursion.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
  - We can avoid infinite loops by making sure that we write good base cases. Base cases are conditionals that stop the recursive function call.
