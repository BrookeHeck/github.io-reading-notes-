# Access Control

## Reading
1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
- RBAC is assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. This is a way of giving an employee access to only parts of the system they need to do their job. It is important for protecting information.

2. Describe a Role/Permission hierarchy that you might implement using RBAC.
- A common one is a the role of admin. At least one person must be able to control the system and the people who are allowed on it. This is generally one or as few people as possible so that only a few people have that much control over the system. Another example would be a user to a social media site. They can post on their profile and like others, but they can't change other people's profile or access other parts of the social media site.

3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
  - Decide what needs access control
  - Create roles based on what needs access control
  - Assign people roles
  - Audit

1. What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.
- Access rights are controlled by the role. A user is given a role, but then what they have access to is controlled by the role of the user. An enterprise setting may be based on the user's job.

2. Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?
- After a user successfully authenticates, the user's rights are activated.

3. Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.
- A business may have private information on customers or employees. Some of the work the business does might be private medical or government records. By using the roles, you can decide who gets access to what part of the network. It's also helpful for stopping anyone from changing settings or files within the system as well.
