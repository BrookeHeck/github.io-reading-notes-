## introducing jsx
1. What is JSX and why do we use it?
- JSX is an extension to JavaScript, it is used with React to describe what the UI should look like
- it looks like template language, but is really JS
- we use JSX because it is a helpful visual aid when working with UI inside JS code

2. Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.
- declare an element, and then you can put any valid js expression inside curly brackets within the element
```js
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
```

3. Is it safe to embed user input in JSX? Explain.
- Yes, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them
