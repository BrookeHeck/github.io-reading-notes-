# Hash Tables

## Terminology
- Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for security. In the case of a hash table, it is used to determine the index of an array
- Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array in a hash table.
- Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hash table
