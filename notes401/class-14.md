# Lab 10 Ideas

## Idea One
- An online jukebox
  - clients can connect to the server
  - the server will send them a music queue that clients can add to or bid on to move songs up the list
  - All clients will be listening from the same queue at the same time as if they were all together listening to a real jukebox

- Spotify API
  - we have clients give us strings to query the Spotify API. We can use the data from Spotify to embed audio into our application so music is actually playing to all clients

- Rooms
  - we can give users the option to breakout of the main room and create a different jukebox.
  - This would be a good feature for a group of friends who aren't together but can listen to music together
  - This would be a good feature for a group of people who like the same kind of music to share some their favorite songs so that others can find new music that they like

## Idea Two
- An auction server
  - People can add items for sale to the site
  - Each item is it's own room
  
- Rooms
  - people can join that room and bid on items

- Server
  - server manages the items for sale, who is in the rooms, what the current highest bid is in the room
  - might be nice to also hold onto all previous bids and show a history of who bid before that and how much
