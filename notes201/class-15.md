# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

## Summary
I can definitely relate to Rozovsky's story about having far more success in a group that is supportive versus competitive. My previous job was working a 24/7 aerial port, and the shifts would often change and so would the team dynamics. The shifts where people didn't care who got the credit for getting the missions done, but cared much more about letting everyone on the team contribute in order to get the job done, were far more successful and happy.

I've never thought about norms as the major influencing factor of a team's success, but it doesn't suprise me either. I took a sociology course once and know the power of groupthink. It's all around us in both good and bad forms. I did find it very interesting that there wasn't really any specific norm that would increase a teams success other than how the group members treated one another. This norm relates to the psychological saftey of a group, which is described in the article as a "a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up". The Project Aristotle team concluded that this was the key factor for measuring a team's success and allowed group members to take risks.

I've heard the saying, "there are no bad teams, only bad leaders", and I think Sakaguchi is a prime example of this saying. The leader doesn't have to be the smartest or most creative person, but they are the ones driving the norms in the group and people will follow their example. Sakaguchi was able to create a more personal work environment where team members were willing to give part of themselves to the team without feeling judged or belittled.
