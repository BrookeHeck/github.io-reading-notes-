# CSS Transform, Transitions, Animations

## Summary
This reading was CSS focused. The articles introduced the basics of transforms, transitions, and animations. These allow developers to change elements based on what is happening on the webpage or when a user triggers an event. These are super common in basically all websites that are built today, and they make the website much more interactive or flowing for the user. There are many different types of each, and I look forward to getting more practice with them.

## CSS Transforms
1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
- Transform allows a developer to change the appearance of an element using the x and y axes (the z axis for 3D transforms). 
- Types of transforms are rotate, scale, translate, and skew.

2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
- A transform might be helpful to show a user something they can click on. For example, if they hover over an element that will perform some event when clicked, then maybe you could use the scale transform to make it larger when the cursor hovers over it.

## CSS Transitions & Animations
1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
- Transitions are a change from one state to another.

2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
- Tansitions allow for css properties to change but must be triggered by some event.
- Animations use keyframes to indicate when the animation should occur. This is helpful for multi-step animations.

## 8 Simple CSS3 transitions that will wow your users
1. What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?
- Transitions make the website more engaging and assist the user with navigating a webpage. My example with scaling something that can be clicked larger is an example of this. It makes the website dynamic and also helps the user know what to click on.

2. How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?
- Static websites are pretty rare when developing websites now. Users are expecting interaction and events when they view a webpage. Learning how to do transforms, transitions, and animations will help me make websites that engage users.

## Things I want to learn more about
- I would like to learn more about how to set up keyframes for animations. I have tried out the transitions before, mostly with the hover pseudo-class, but I've never done any type of animation.
