# Node.js

## Summary
The first article was an introduction to Node.js. Node allows JavaScript to be run outside of a browser, and this widens the scope that we can use JavaScript. One important use of node is that it allows us to create servers using JavaScript. The article also talked briefly about npm. This is a massive software registry for node packages and allows us to easily install these packages into our own projects.

## An Introduction to Node.js
1. What is node.js?

    The Node.js home page says:
    >Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
    It basically means that you can run JavaScript outside of the browser and inside a terminal.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

    Chrome's V8 JS Engine is what compile's JavaScript into machine code so that it can be executed by a computer. It is open-source and runs in many web-browsers.

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

    This means that node is a compiler for JavaScript but doesn't run inside the browser. It still turns the code into machine language and JS code or applications can be executed from the console.

4. What is npm?

    npm is a package manager that lets you easily install node packages. It is also a software registry that people can download their packages onto.

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

    v18.5.0

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

    8.12.1

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

    ``` npm i jshint ```

8. What is node used for?

    One major use of node is running JavaScript on a server. Node allows the server to be single threaded and event driven. This means the server has little overhead and can handle multiple connections at the same time.

## Six Reasons for Pair Programming
1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

    Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, work environment readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

    I think engaged collaboration has been the most beneficial for me. The pair programming labs were really the first collaborative coding I've ever done and I'm continuing to to learn to work with others to make better code.

3. How does pair programming work?

    One person drives and is actually typing out the code. The other person navigates, and is telling the driver what to type.
