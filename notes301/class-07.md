# Rest

## Summary
This article a conversation about how different machines and systems communicate with one another using HTTP. 

## How I explained REST to my brother
1. Who is Roy Fielding?

    Roy Fielding helped Ryan Tomayko and others develop web servers that sent documents across the internet. In order to do this, they developed the protocol HTTP. Using URLs, HTTP requests are able to get, post, and update information anywhere on the internet. HTTP requests have made APIs incredibly popular by getting information from other servers much easier than previous software development techniques.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

    The developers used techniques that got a small group of machines to talk to one another, but talking to all machines was not a primary concern.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    GET, POST, PUT, PATCH

4. What does a GET do?

    A GET requests retrieves information from another system.

5. What does a POST do?

    A POST requests add something to another system.

6. What does PUT do?

    A PUT request replaces something in a system.

7. What does PATCH do?

    A PATCH request does a partial update in a system.
