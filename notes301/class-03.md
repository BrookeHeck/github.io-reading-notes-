# Passing Functions as Props

## Summary
The first two articles introduced two very helpful methods that can be used with arrays. The first one, map, loops through an array, but uses a callback to update that element in the array and return the updated element. The map function then returns the updated array.

Spread is used to used to take elements out of array and work with them separately. This could be used in many cases, but some common uses for this could be to combine arrays, using an array as an argument, or updating states in React.

Lastly, the video was a demonstration on how to pass functions from a parent component to a child component in React. This is done in the same way that other props are passed between components. Once you pass the function name as a prop in the render function of the parent component, it can be invoked by calling this.props in the child component.

## React Docs - lists and keys
1. What does .map() return?

    Map returns an array. It will loop through an array and execute a callback function for each iteration. Whatever the callback function returns will be added to a new array, and that new array is what is returned.

2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

    It is the same concept and syntax but the code must be inside of curly braces.

3. Each list item needs a unique ____.

    Key

4. What is the purpose of a key?

    Keys are used for extracting components. They serve as an ID for a specific component.

## The Spread Operator
1. What is the spread operator?

    The spread syntax is used to make elements of an array into individual arguments.

2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

    The spread operator is useful for copying an array, combining arrays, using array elements in math functions, using an array as an argument, adding to state in react, or converting a NodeList into an array

3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
    ```
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    arr2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    let combine = (arr1, arr2) => [...arr1, ...arr2];

    console.log(combine(arr1, arr2));
    ```
    Output
    ```
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    ```

4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
    ```
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    arr2 = [7, 8, 9, 10];

    let combine = (arr1, arr2) => [...arr1, 6, ...arr2];

    console.log(combine(arr1, arr2));
    ```
    Output
    ```
    [1, 2, 3, 4,  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    ```

5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

    ```
    obj1 = { first: 'Brooke' };
    obj2 = { last: 'Heck' };

    let combine = (obj1, obj2) => {
    return { ...obj1, ...obj2 }
    };
    console.log(combine(obj1, obj2));
    ```
    Output
    ```
    { first: 'Brooke', last: 'Heck'}
    ```

## How to Pass Functions Between Components
1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

    In the video, the first thing that he did was create a function in the App class that will be passed down to the child component in the render function.

2. In your own words, what does the increment function do?

    The increment function creates an array within that scope and use map to loop through the people array created in the constructor. If the name passed to the increment function matches one of the names in the people array, then the counter is incremented for that specific person. The updated array returned by the map function is used to update the state array.

3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

    It is passed the same way any other prop is passed. You give the prop a key name and then set it equal to the function created in that class.

5. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

    You can invoke that function by call this.props. and then the name that the prop was given in the parent component.
