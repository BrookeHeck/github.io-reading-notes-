## Component Based Architecture
1. What is a “component”?

    [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm) uses these characteristics to describe a component.
    - Reusability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, independent
3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

     [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm) lists these advantages of component-based architecture.
     - Ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of development, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, and independent

## Things I want to learn more about
- I've only looked at some really basic examples of react, but most of them have showed me how to make titles and basic components that look exactly like html tags. I know React is popular, so there must be a lot more you can do with it. I want to learn more about React components and how they interact with each other.
